# Another-demo
1st not working. Testing
Let's see how to make it work. Files don't automatically get saved in windows file system. That creates a problem when using cd as there is no path to the wanted/desired path.( as there is no file)
# next change
The clone directory worked and the file was copied to the local file system.
But the git status command still not working properly.
